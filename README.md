# HTML-CSS-Capstone-Project
This is my HTML & CSS capstone project, the project aims to customize a website based on  [this]( https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX) page designed by Mohammed Awad. I picked a pet store as a theme. The main page is the landing page and you can navigate to the result page by clicking on any Department link or service.
